# CPG
It was the research project for my master's thesis.

I was very interested in computational neuroscience, so I chose a topic to model and analyze a 3 neuron neural network in a pond snail.
However, the lack of experimental data means it is impossible to create a model faithfully representing the original system, and due to other
difficulties in life, mainly financial concern, I switched to the course-based program and gave up further working on this project.
The project ended to be an artificial CPG and I have learned a lot about differential equations during this study.
